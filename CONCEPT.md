# Seven Starfalls: Collective Unconscious

## Core Concept

Seven Starfalls reimagines collaborative storytelling as a journey through a fragmenting collective mind. Instead of external community building, players navigate the psychological landscape of a dying or transforming consciousness.

## Game Philosophy

### The Collective Unconscious
- The "community" is actually one entity's fragmenting psyche
- Players embody psychological forces and archetypal drives within this mind
- The landscape is psychogeographical - literal terrain that shifts based on mental/emotional states
- Reality follows dream logic rather than physical causality

### AI as Psychological Archetypes
Each AI agent represents a fundamental psychological force:
- **The Shadow** - repressed fears, denied aspects of self
- **The Anima/Animus** - the contra-sexual aspect, inspiration, soul
- **The Mother** - nurturing, protection, but also devouring control
- **The Trickster** - chaos, transformation, boundary dissolution
- **The Wise Old Man/Woman** - guidance, but also rigid tradition
- **The Child** - innocence, potential, but also helplessness
- **The Hero** - action, achievement, but also destructive ego

### Seven Starfalls Structure
Each starfall represents a moment of psychological crisis or breakthrough:
1. **First Starfall** - Initial fragmentation, the mind begins to split
2. **Second Starfall** - Shadow material emerges from repression
3. **Third Starfall** - Childhood trauma/memories surface
4. **Fourth Starfall** - Core identity crisis, who am I?
5. **Fifth Starfall** - Confrontation with mortality/finitude
6. **Sixth Starfall** - Integration attempts, trying to heal
7. **Seventh Starfall** - Resolution, death, or transformation

### Transformed Mechanics

**Map as Psychogeography**
- Landscapes shift based on emotional states
- "Projects" become psychological healing/integration attempts
- "Resources" are emotional/mental capacities (hope, memory, will)
- "Threats" are psychological symptoms or breakdowns

**Contempt as Fragmentation**
- Instead of social disagreement, represents psychological dissociation
- Accumulating contempt = increasing mental fragmentation
- Can be healed through integration or acceptance of shadow material

**Actions Reimagined**
- **Discover Something New** → Uncover repressed memories or aspects
- **Hold a Discussion** → Internal dialogue between psychological forces
- **Start a Project** → Begin psychological healing or defensive mechanisms

### Demanding AI Experience
- AI agents must maintain archetypal consistency while adapting to psychological chaos
- Each agent pursues their psychological drive while the overall mind seeks resolution
- Narrative logic follows dream/unconscious patterns rather than rational causality
- Agents must rationalize increasingly surreal psychological landscapes

### Freaky and Chaotic Elements
- Reality can shift based on psychological state
- Past and present blur through memory and trauma
- Physical laws bend to emotional/psychological forces
- The boundary between self and other dissolves
- Multiple contradictory truths can exist simultaneously

## Design Goals
- Create genuinely unsettling AI-driven narratives
- Explore psychological themes through collaborative storytelling
- Generate emergent stories that feel authentically dreamlike
- Challenge AI agents to think beyond rational problem-solving
- Produce narratives with genuine emotional and psychological depth
